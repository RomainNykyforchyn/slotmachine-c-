## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This is a simple slot machine made in C#. You can enter your bet and click on "Start". Due to this was one of my earlier projects, this program contains a mp3-file, because I wanted to learn how to use sound-files in C#.

Because this project was made in visual studio and it contains a .sln file, I recommend to open the project in Visual Studio.
